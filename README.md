## Process and objectives

The idea and layout of the projects are from devChallenge and you can <a href="https://devchallenges.io/challenges/mM1UIenRhK808W8qmLWv" target="_blank">check here</a>. The API suggested in the challenge is offline, so the app is using another one.

The application was built with **ReactJS** and **TypeScript**, for http calls the **Axios** library was chosen. To prioritize responsiveness and speed up app build, I used **Bootstrap 5** with some CSS replaced in **Sass**. Search input validation was done with **RegExp**.

The main objective was to practice manipulating data and using an API. In addition, I had the opportunity to practice and improve the prior knowledge of some technologies and the structure of thinking to develop a web application.
